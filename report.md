In this lab, I learned how to use Git and GitHub for version control. 
I created and modified files using Git Bash commands. 
I practiced committing changes with meaningful messages. 
I also learned how to create branches and merge them into the main branch. 
This lab helped me understand how developers manage projects professionally.
